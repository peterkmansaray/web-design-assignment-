        <h1>About Football Agency Sierra Leone</h1>
        <p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Football Agency Sierra Leone was created after seeing many talented players
                with limited access to structured training, fair representation or basic
                career advice. We began by organising community sessions and informal
                mentorship, and have grown into a simple but committed agency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, we combine training, personal development and exposure. We insist
                on discipline, respect and education, so that players are prepared for life
                on and off the pitch.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top:1.5rem;">What We Do</h2>
            <ul class="player-info-list">
